# Capstone-Part-2

### Project Title

Using Weather Data to Predict Daily Customer Traffic

Author: Dr. Justin Bankert

#### Executive summary

The goal for this capstone project is to create a model that will allow me to predict the daily
customer traffic at a business that is owned by one of my family members by analyzing predictable
weather information (e.g. temperature, precipitation probability, humidity, etc.)

#### Rationale
Why should anyone care about this question?

#### Research Question

Can daily customer traffic be predicted from forecastable weather data?

#### Data Sources

The sources of my data will be 1) A tally of daily customer traffic that is kept by the business
in question and 2) This website: (https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-data) which gives
detailed historical weather data for a particular location.

#### Methodology

I am going to several different neural networks (averaging their predictions).

#### Results

I found that I was able to produce a model which can predict (to within an accuracy of a few) the
daily customer traffic. 

#### Next steps

For the next steps, I would like to see if I can use the the predicted traffic data along with
the weather data to be able to predict the gross daily sales for the business.
