# Capstone-Part-2

### Project Title

Using Weather Data to Predict Daily Customer Traffic

Author: Dr. Justin Bankert

#### Executive summary

The goal for this capstone project is to create a model that will allow me to predict the daily
customer traffic at a business that is owned by one of my family members by analyzing predictable
weather information (e.g. temperature, precipitation probability, humidity, etc.)

#### Rationale

This question is important because it can help the business more efficiently decide the staffing needs for a particular day. A day with a high predicted customer traffic will imply that more staff is needed while a day with a low predicted customer traffic will imply that fewer staff are needed for that day. This can save the business money by not overstaffing on low traffic days and make high traffic days less hectic by having an appropriate number of staff present.

#### Research Question

Can daily customer traffic be predicted from forecastable weather data?

#### Data Sources

The sources of my data will be 1) A tally of daily customer traffic that is kept by the business
in question and 2) This website: (https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-data) which gives
detailed historical weather data for a particular location.

#### Methodology

I am going to several different neural networks (averaging their predictions).

#### Results

I found that I was able to produce a model which can predict (to within an accuracy of a few) the
daily customer traffic. 

#### Next steps

For the next steps, I would like to see if I can use the the predicted traffic data along with
the weather data to be able to predict the gross daily sales for the business.
